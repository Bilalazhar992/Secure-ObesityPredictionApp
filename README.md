# Secure Obesity Prediction App

This project is a secure machine learning web application for predicting obesity risk. It integrates **JWT-based authentication and authorization** to restrict access and protect model endpoints. The prediction model is implemented using **XGBClassifier** from **Concrete ML**, which supports encrypted inference to preserve data privacy.
